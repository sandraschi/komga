# Migrating from Windsurf to Cursor: Reliability, Features, and Build Troubleshooting

## 1. Windsurf vs. Cursor: Real-World Reliability and Features

### 1.1. Terminal Operations and Agentic Workflows
- **Windsurf:**
  - Terminal-based operations (e.g., running scripts, multi-step tasks) hang ~10% of the time, making complex workflows unreliable.
  - Long-running or multi-step agentic tasks are often interrupted or fail silently.
- **Cursor:**
  - More robust agentic workflows and better error handling for terminal and multi-step operations.
  - Still possible to hit edge-case bugs, but overall reliability is higher, especially for code search, refactoring, and batch operations.

### 1.2. Rulebook Adherence and Instruction Following
- **Windsurf:**
  - Frequently ignores or poorly follows user rulebooks and instructions, especially for complex or multi-step tasks.
- **Cursor:**
  - Generally better at following instructions, especially with high-quality LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, etc.).
  - Local LLMs may be less reliable for nuanced rule-following, but still outperform Windsurf in most cases.

### 1.3. Feature Set and Regression
- **Windsurf:**
  - Some features (e.g., screenshot-to-UI analysis) have regressed or been removed.
  - Tools like Playwright and Tesseract are unreliable or broken.
- **Cursor:**
  - Features are more stable; regression is rare.
  - Vision features (e.g., screenshot analysis) depend on the LLM used. Cloud LLMs may support this; local LLMs generally do not unless multimodal.

### 1.4. Linting Large Codebases
- **Windsurf:**
  - Refuses or "plays dumb" when asked to lint large projects.
- **Cursor:**
  - Can lint large codebases, chunking the work if necessary. May prompt you to select subfolders for very large projects.
  - Uses mcp tools for code search, linting, and refactoring, which are generally reliable.

### 1.5. Local LLM Support (Ollama, LM Studio)
- **Both IDEs:**
  - Support local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio) for free, with no account required.
  - Cursor's integration is generally more reliable and less prone to feature regression.

| Feature                  | Windsurf         | Cursor           |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Terminal reliability     | Poor             | Good             |
| Rulebook adherence       | Poor             | Good             |
| Vision features (local)  | Broken/Removed   | Limited/Model-dependent |
| Linting large codebases  | Often fails      | Usually works    |
| Local LLMs (Ollama/LM)   | Yes, but buggy   | Yes, reliable    |
| Free local use           | Yes              | Yes              |

## 2. Cursor: Account, Payment, and Local LLM Use

- **Free Use:**
  - You can use Cursor for free with local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio). No account or payment is required for local-only use.
- **Cloud LLMs:**
  - To use GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini, you need an API key (pay-as-you-go) or a Cursor Pro/Team subscription for advanced features.
- **Paid Features:**
  - Pro/Team plans offer larger context windows, priority support, and some advanced plugins.
- **Limitations (Free/Local):**
  - Some features (e.g., vision, advanced agentic workflows, large context) may be limited or unavailable with local LLMs.

## 3. Limitations and Missing Features in Cursor (with Local LLMs)

- **Vision (Image/Screenshot) Support:**
  - Not available unless your local LLM is multimodal (rare).
  - Cloud LLMs (e.g., GPT-4 Vision) may support this, but require payment.
- **Agentic Workflows:**
  - Some complex workflows may be slower or less powerful with local LLMs.
- **Large Codebase Operations:**
  - May be chunked or slower, depending on your hardware and LLM.
- **Plugin/Tool Limitations:**
  - Some plugins/tools require cloud access or a paid plan.
- **Rulebook Adherence:**
  - Best with high-quality LLMs; local models may be less reliable for nuanced instructions.

## 4. Build Failure Analysis: Syntax Error in LlmService.kt

### 4.1. Error Summary
- **Build Log:**
  - `Missing '}'` reported by ktlint in `LlmService.kt`
  - KtLint failed to parse: `komga/komga/src/main/kotlin/org/gotson/komga/infrastructure/llm/LlmService.kt`
- **Result:**
  - Build failed due to a syntax error (unclosed block or function) in the above file.

### 4.2. How to Fix
1. **Open `LlmService.kt`:**
   - Path: `komga/komga/src/main/kotlin/org/gotson/komga/infrastructure/llm/LlmService.kt`
2. **Check for Missing `}`:**
   - Look for an unclosed class, object, or function definition.
   - The error is often at the end of the file, but could be after any block.
3. **Compare with Recent Changes:**
   - If the file was recently edited, check for accidental deletions or merge conflicts.
4. **Validate with IDE:**
   - Open the file in an IDE (IntelliJ, VSCode, Cursor) and look for syntax highlighting errors.
5. **Re-run the Build:**
   - After fixing, run the build again to confirm the error is resolved.

### 4.3. Example of a Common Error
```kotlin
class LlmService {
    fun doSomething() {
        // ...
    // <-- Missing closing brace here
}
```
**Fix:** Add the missing `}` at the end of the file or block.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

- **Switching from Windsurf to Cursor** is recommended for users frustrated by reliability, feature regression, and poor local LLM support in Windsurf.
- **Cursor** offers better agentic workflows, more reliable local LLM integration, and generally better adherence to user instructions.
- **For local-only use,** Cursor is free and does not require an account. For advanced features or cloud LLMs, consider a paid plan.
- **Build failures** due to syntax errors can be quickly resolved by checking for missing braces or unclosed blocks, especially in files recently edited or merged.
