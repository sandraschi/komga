# AI Extensions - Part 5: Future Directions and Vision

This Komga fork aims to be at the forefront of integrating cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence into the digital library experience. The current LLM and RAG capabilities are just the beginning. This section outlines the planned enhancements, roadmap, and long-term vision for AI within Komga.

## 1. Planned Enhancements and Roadmap

*(This section should detail specific, actionable items on the development roadmap. These could be short-term goals or features planned for upcoming releases.)*

### Short-Term (Next 1-3 Months)

*   **Enhanced UI for AI Features:**
    *   More intuitive LLM provider configuration with better validation and feedback.
    *   Improved display of semantic search results, including source highlighting and context snippets.
    *   User interface for managing RAG indexing (trigger re-index, view status, clear index for a book).
*   **Refinement of RAG Pipeline:**
    *   Improved text extraction for problematic PDF layouts.
    *   Experimentation with different chunking strategies and embedding models for better relevance.
    *   More robust error handling and logging throughout the pipeline.
*   **Basic "Chat with your Book" Prototype:**
    *   Initial implementation allowing users to ask direct questions about a single selected book.

### Mid-Term (Next 3-9 Months)

*   **Advanced Semantic Search Capabilities:**
    *   Implementation of LLM-powered query expansion or HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings).
    *   Support for filtering semantic search results by multiple metadata fields (genre, tags, publication year, etc.) combined with semantic relevance.
    *   Cross-book semantic search and Q&A (e.g., "Compare the themes of book A and book B").
*   **Proactive Content Insights:**
    *   Automated generation of summaries, keywords, and thematic tags for new books upon import.
    *   UI for users to review, edit, and approve AI-generated metadata.
*   **Personalization:**
    *   AI-powered recommendations based on reading history and semantic similarity to currently viewed or read books.
    *   Personalized search result ranking.
*   **Multi-Modal RAG (Experimental):**
    *   Begin research and prototyping for incorporating image-based content (e.g., from comics) into the RAG system, potentially using multi-modal embedding models and OCR for text extraction from images.

### Long-Term (Beyond 9 Months)

*   **Conversational Library Assistant:**
    *   A sophisticated AI assistant that users can interact with using natural language to manage their library, discover books, get complex analyses, and more.
*   **Knowledge Graph Integration:**
    *   Building a knowledge graph from library content, linking characters, concepts, themes, and authors, and using this graph to power even more insightful queries and discovery.
*   **Comparative Analysis Tools:**
    *   Tools to perform deep comparative analysis across multiple books or authors (e.g., "Trace the evolution of a specific theme across all books by Author X").
*   **User-Trained/Fine-Tuned Models (Ambitious):**
    *   Exploring possibilities for users to (optionally and with clear guidance) fine-tune smaller, local LLMs on their specific library data or preferences for highly personalized results.
*   **Collaborative AI Features:**
    *   (If applicable to Komga's user base) Features allowing users to share or discuss AI-generated insights within a trusted group.

## 2. Long-Term Vision for AI in Komga

The ultimate vision is to transform Komga from a digital comic/book server into an **intelligent content companion**. We envision a future where AI seamlessly integrates with the user's reading experience, making their library more accessible, engaging, and insightful.

Key pillars of this long-term vision include:

*   **Deep Understanding:** AI that doesn't just process text but truly understands the nuances of narrative, character, theme, and style within the library's content.
*   **Effortless Discovery:** Moving beyond simple search to a system where users can discover books and information in intuitive, conversational ways, uncovering hidden gems and connections they might otherwise miss.
*   **Personalized Experience:** AI that learns individual user preferences and tailors its interactions, recommendations, and analyses accordingly.
*   **Creative Empowerment:** Tools that not only help users consume content but also engage with it creatively (e.g., generating alternative scenarios, exploring 'what-if' questions about plots).
*   **Accessibility:** Leveraging AI to make content more accessible, for example, through automated descriptions for visually impaired users or simplified summaries for complex texts.
*   **Ethical and User-Controlled AI:** Ensuring that AI features are implemented responsibly, with user privacy and control at the forefront. Users should understand how AI is being used and have agency over their data and the AI's behavior.

By pursuing these future directions, this Komga fork aims to redefine what a personal digital library can be, making it a dynamic and intelligent partner in the exploration of literature and comics.
