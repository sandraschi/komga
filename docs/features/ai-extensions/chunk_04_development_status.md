# AI Extensions - Part 4: Development Status and Testing

This section provides an overview of the current development status, known issues, and testing strategies for the AI extensions integrated into this Komga fork. Understanding this is crucial for contributors, testers, and users who wish to leverage or further develop these advanced features.

## 1. Current Build Status of AI Features

*(This section requires specific input regarding the stability and completeness of the AI features in the current main development branch, presumably `master`.)*

*   **Overall Stability:** (e.g., Alpha, Beta, Stable with caveats)
*   **LLM Integration Module:**
    *   Core service functionality: (e.g., Operational, Partially implemented)
    *   Provider support (OpenAI, Ollama, LM Studio, etc.): (e.g., Which are fully tested? Which are experimental?)
*   **RAG Pipeline:**
    *   Document Processing (Extraction, Chunking, Embedding): (e.g., Stable for common formats like EPUB/PDF? Known issues with specific formats?)
    *   Vector Database Interaction (ChromaDB): (e.g., Stable, Performance characteristics)
    *   RAG Service Orchestration: (e.g., Core query flow working? Advanced analysis features like thematic analysis implemented?)
*   **UI Components:**
    *   LLM Configuration Panel: (e.g., Implemented, Basic functionality, Needs polish)
    *   Semantic Search Interface: (e.g., Prototype, Actively used, Integrated with RAG backend)
    *   AI Analysis Display: (e.g., Placeholder, Displays basic results)

**Key Indicators:**
*   **Last Successful Build with AI Features:** (e.g., Build number/date, Link to CI/CD pipeline if public)
*   **Automated Tests Passing:** (e.g., Percentage of AI-related unit/integration tests passing)

## 2. Identified Missing Parts, Components, or Known Issues

*(This section should list any significant gaps in functionality, planned features not yet implemented, or known bugs. This could be sourced from an issue tracker, project board, or internal development notes.)*

### Missing Core Components:

*   **(Example)** Full asynchronous processing for initial library indexing via RAG.
*   **(Example)** Comprehensive error handling and reporting for LLM API failures across all providers.
*   **(Example)** User-facing UI for managing RAG indexing tasks (e.g., re-index book, view indexing status).

### Planned Features Not Yet Implemented:

*   **(Example)** Interactive "Chat with your Book" feature.
*   **(Example)** LLM-powered query expansion for semantic search.
*   **(Example)** Support for image-based RAG (e.g., OCRing comic pages for text to embed).
*   **(Example)** User feedback mechanism for AI-generated content.

### Known Issues / Bugs:

*   **(Example)** `[BUG-XYZ]` Ollama integration times out with very large models on resource-constrained systems.
*   **(Example)** `[BUG-ABC]` Semantic search occasionally returns irrelevant results for highly ambiguous queries.
*   **(Example)** Text extraction from scanned PDFs with complex layouts is unreliable.
*   **(Example)** UI for LLM provider configuration lacks validation for some input fields.

*(Links to an actual issue tracker (GitHub Issues, Jira, etc.) would be highly beneficial here.)*

## 3. Test Scaffolding, Testing Strategies, and Tools

Ensuring the reliability and accuracy of AI features requires a robust testing strategy.

### a. Unit Testing

*   **Scope:** Testing individual components in isolation.
    *   LLM Service clients for each provider (mocking external API calls).
    *   Text Extractor logic for different file formats (using sample files).
    *   Document Chunker for various text inputs and configurations.
    *   Embedding Generator (mocking embedding model calls, verifying output structure).
    *   VectorStore interaction logic (using an in-memory or temporary ChromaDB instance).
*   **Tools:** (e.g., JUnit/Kotest for Kotlin, PyTest for Python components, Mockito/MockK for mocking).

### b. Integration Testing

*   **Scope:** Testing interactions between components.
    *   Full RAG pipeline flow: from document ingestion to query result, using a small, controlled dataset and a local/mocked LLM.
    *   API endpoint testing for LLM and RAG services.
*   **Tools:** (e.g., Spring Boot Test for Kotlin/Java backend, Testcontainers for managing Dockerized dependencies like ChromaDB or Ollama in tests).

### c. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

*   **Scope:** Testing the entire system from the user's perspective, including UI interactions.
    *   Simulating user actions like configuring an LLM provider, running a semantic search, viewing AI-generated analysis.
*   **Tools:** (e.g., Selenium, Cypress, Playwright for UI automation).

### d. Performance Testing

*   **Scope:** Evaluating the speed and resource consumption of AI features.
    *   RAG indexing time for libraries of various sizes.
    *   Semantic search query latency.
    *   LLM response times for different providers and models.
    *   Memory and CPU usage during indexing and querying.
*   **Tools:** (e.g., JMeter, k6, custom scripting with profiling tools).

### e. Qualitative Testing / Evaluation

*   **Scope:** Assessing the quality, relevance, and accuracy of LLM-generated content and search results. This is often more subjective and requires human evaluation.
*   **Methods:**
    *   Golden datasets: A set of queries with known ideal answers/retrieved documents.
    *   Human evaluation panels rating search result relevance or answer coherence.
    *   Metrics like RAGAs (RAG Assessment) or custom evaluation scripts focusing on faithfulness, answer relevance, context precision/recall.

### f. Current Test Scaffolding

*(This requires input on what test infrastructure is currently in place.)*

*   **Unit Test Coverage:** (e.g., Approximate percentage for key AI modules).
*   **Integration Test Suite:** (e.g., Exists, Covers main RAG flow, Run in CI?)
*   **E2E Test Suite:** (e.g., Not yet implemented, Basic smoke tests exist).
*   **CI/CD Integration:** (e.g., Are tests automatically run on commits/PRs? Which ones?)

Maintaining comprehensive tests is vital for the iterative development and stability of these complex AI features.
