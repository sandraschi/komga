# AI-Powered Content Analysis with RAG

## Overview

Komga's AI-powered content analysis leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide intelligent insights and metadata enhancement for your digital library. This feature uses state-of-the-art language models to understand and analyze the content of your books, enabling powerful search and discovery capabilities.

## Features

- **Content Analysis**: Automatically extracts key themes, topics, and summaries from book content
- **Smart Search**: Find books using natural language queries that understand the actual content
- **Metadata Enhancement**: Suggests relevant tags, genres, and categories based on content analysis
- **Reading Recommendations**: Get personalized book recommendations based on your reading history
- **Semantic Search**: Search for concepts and ideas, not just keywords
- **Multi-language Support**: Works with multiple languages in your library

## How It Works

1. **Content Indexing**: When a book is added to Komga, its content is processed and indexed
2. **Vector Embeddings**: Text content is converted into vector embeddings that capture semantic meaning
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines retrieval of relevant content with generation of responses
4. **Query Processing**: Natural language queries are processed to understand user intent
5. **Results Generation**: Relevant content is retrieved and presented in a meaningful way

## Configuration

### Enabling AI Features

1. Navigate to Settings > AI Features
2. Enable "AI Content Analysis"
3. Configure the desired analysis depth and processing priority
4. Select which libraries should be processed

### API Keys

To use cloud-based AI features, you'll need to provide API keys for the following services:

- OpenAI API Key (for GPT models)
- Vector Database API Key (optional, for enhanced performance)

## Usage

### Smart Search

Use natural language to find content:

- "Find books about space exploration published in the last 5 years"
- "Show me mystery novels with strong female protagonists"
- "Find books similar to Dune"

### Content Analysis

View AI-generated insights for each book:

- Key themes and topics
- Character analysis
- Plot summaries (without spoilers)
- Reading level assessment

### Metadata Enhancement

AI can suggest:
- Relevant tags and genres
- Book summaries
- Content warnings
- Reading age recommendations

## Privacy Considerations

- All processing can be done locally on your server
- No content is sent to external services without explicit configuration
- You can choose which metadata is shared for cloud-based features

## Performance Impact

- Initial indexing may take time for large libraries
- Processing can be scheduled during off-peak hours
- Resource usage can be limited in settings

## Troubleshooting

If AI features aren't working:

1. Verify your API keys are correctly configured
2. Check that the AI service is running and accessible
3. Review the server logs for any error messages
4. Ensure your system meets the minimum requirements

## Future Enhancements

- Support for more AI models and providers
- Enhanced content analysis (sentiment, tone, style)
- Automated content tagging and categorization
- Integration with external knowledge bases
- Custom training for personalization
