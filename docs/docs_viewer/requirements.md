# Original User Request and Requirements for docs_viewer

---

can you make a new subproject ? we have a docs folder tree with mostly markdown files. i want a beautiful documentation viewer. should be a three colum layout. left column has a tree display of all files in the folder tree. middle part shows properly rendered markdown. other text formats should also be rendered correctly (pdf, docx...) right column shows selected file metasata. the viewer must also support tagging, starring, commenzing, filter and seach. also must let user select another folder on the pc as the start point of the folder tree. click a button to show windows folder select dialoh, when selected ebuild the doc tree. should have light/dark switch. make it in a new docs_viewer folder in our repo. make frontend ui and backend. not too complicated, auth not necessary. should be usable in ios later. should be importable to other repos. make it a powerful tool. make it quickly with minimal user intervention. make a prd that describes the subproject, also a readmo. extensive logging, error catching and user friendliness  is a ust. give me your analysis of thesubproject and immediately go to work. be fast and thorough, no tangents please

excellent plan. i approve, scaffold it and build it now. later i want rag for file content and metadata added. sqlize is fine, maybe chromadb to easily extend to rag ? we have rag in our project but keep it self contained for now. please start, no more input from me needed. present a report when you have completely made it. dont forget extenive testing tools

proceed all the way to complete functionality ! make it beauttiful and useful ! also add your suggestions for further improvements , extensions and integrations. edit functionality, llm document improvement/extension/summarizing/crosslinking. whatever you thik is feasible. also preserve my original request. put subproject documentation in a new subfolder of the repo docs

make it ! a little additional reuest: ai integration has to support local ollama/lmstudio/vllm with convenient listing/loading/unloading of models

please proceed with a large batch of file edits or a full implementation in one go

continue. do it all in one go
