# Calibre Documentation - Part 1: The E-book Management Powerhouse

## 1. What is Calibre?

Calibre is a powerful, free, and open-source e-book management suite. Often described as a "one-stop solution for all your e-book needs," it provides a comprehensive set of tools for organizing, viewing, converting, editing, and sharing e-book collections. It is designed for users who want to maintain extensive digital libraries and have granular control over their e-books and metadata.

Born on October 31, 2006, shortly after the release of the SONY PRS-500 e-reader, Calibre started as `libprs500` by Kovid Goyal to enable e-reader support on Linux. It evolved to include e-book conversion and eventually a graphical interface for library management, being renamed Calibre in mid-2008. The name, chosen by Kovid's wife Krittika, emphasizes freedom (from "libre") and is pronounced "cali-ber."

Calibre is developed by a vibrant open-source community of book lovers, for book lovers, with a strong emphasis on user control and preventing market fragmentation or monopolization.
