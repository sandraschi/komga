  - Local processing
  - Community-driven

## Technical Approaches

### Architecture Patterns

1. **Extension-Based**
   - Pros: Easy distribution, familiar interface
   - Cons: Limited by host IDE capabilities
   - Examples: Continue, Codeium OSS

2. **Standalone Applications**
   - Pros: Full control over experience
   - Cons: Higher development complexity
   - Examples: OpenDevin

### Model Integration

#### Local Models
- **Pros**:
  - No API costs
  - Complete privacy
  - No rate limits
- **Cons**:
  - Hardware requirements
  - Lower quality than cloud models
  - Slower performance

#### Cloud Models
- **Pros**:
  - Better performance
  - Access to larger models
  - No local setup
- **Cons**:
  - API costs
  - Privacy concerns
  - Rate limiting

## Challenges

### Technical Hurdles

1. **Performance**
   - Latency in code analysis
   - Memory constraints
   - Context window limitations

2. **Model Quality**
   - Training data limitations
   - Fine-tuning requirements
   - Context management

### User Experience

- Setup complexity
- Feature parity with Windsurf
- Documentation and support

## Comparison with Windsurf

| Feature | Windsurf | FOSS Alternatives |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Model Quality | Excellent (GPT-4 class) | Good (Smaller models) |
| Setup | One-click install | Complex setup |
| Cost | Subscription | Free |
| Features | Comprehensive | Limited |
| Support | Professional | Community |
| Privacy | Cloud-based | Local options |
| Customization | Limited | High |

## Future Possibilities

### Promising Directions

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Plugin system for models
   - Extensible features
