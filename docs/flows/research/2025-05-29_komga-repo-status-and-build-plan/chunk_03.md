## 5. Deeper Dive into Gradle: Concepts, Troubleshooting, and Best Practices

Understanding the nuances of Gradle is crucial for maintaining a healthy and efficient build process, especially for a multi-module project like Komga.

### 5.1. Resource Filtering (`processResources`) Revisited:

*   **Mechanism:** Gradle's `processResources` task, part of the Java plugin, copies files from `src/main/resources` to `build/resources/main`. The `expand(project.properties)` directive within its configuration block enables token replacement using Groovy's `SimpleTemplateEngine`.
*   **Problem Encountered:** YAML files (`application-*.yml`) containing Spring Boot's property placeholders (e.g., `${ENV_VAR:default_value}`) were misinterpreted as Groovy template expressions, leading to parsing errors.
*   **Solution Implemented:** `exclude("**/*.yml", "**/*.yaml")` within the `processResources` task configuration. This tells Gradle to copy these files verbatim, without attempting template expansion. Spring Boot itself handles the resolution of its property placeholders at runtime.
*   **Best Practice:** Be explicit about which files need templating. If only a few files require it, consider an `include` pattern for those specific files and exclude everything else, or use `filesMatching` to target them. For most Spring Boot projects, YAML/properties files should *not* be processed by Gradle's templating engine.

### 5.2. Gradle Daemon: Understanding and Managing

*   **Purpose:** The Gradle Daemon is a long-lived background process that significantly speeds up builds by keeping build information in memory, avoiding JVM startup costs, and enabling caching of project structures.
*   **`--no-daemon` Usage:** This flag is invaluable for debugging as it runs the build in a fresh, isolated process. This helps rule out issues caused by a stale or corrupted daemon state.
*   **Managing the Daemon:**
    *   `gradlew --stop`: Stops all daemons for the current Gradle version.
    *   `gradlew --status`: Shows running/idle daemons.
    *   Daemon logs are typically in `%USERPROFILE%\.gradle\daemon\<version>\daemon-<pid>.out.log`.
*   **Common Daemon Issues:**
    *   **Stale State/Memory Leaks:** Can cause hangs or incorrect build behavior. Regular stops or using `--no-daemon` can help.
    *   **File Locking:** The daemon might hold locks on files, interfering with external processes or subsequent builds.
    *   **Resource Consumption:** A misbehaving daemon can consume excessive memory or CPU.
*   **Best Practice:** Use the daemon for regular development. If build problems arise, use `--no-daemon` as a first diagnostic step. Ensure sufficient memory is allocated to the daemon via `org.gradle.jvmargs` in `gradle.properties`.

### 5.3. Gradle Version and Wrapper:

*   **Current Version:** Komga uses Gradle 8.11.1, as specified in `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` (`distributionUrl`).
*   **Gradle Wrapper (`gradlew`):** This script ensures that everyone working on the project uses the same Gradle version, leading to consistent and reproducible builds. It downloads the specified Gradle version if not already present.
*   **Updating Gradle:** To update, run `.\gradlew wrapper --gradle-version <new_version> --distribution-type all` (or `bin-only`).
*   **Compatibility:** Always check plugin compatibility before major Gradle version upgrades.

### 5.4. Kotlin DSL (`build.gradle.kts`):

*   **Advantages:** Offers type safety, better IDE support (autocompletion, refactoring), and allows for more idiomatic Kotlin code in build scripts compared to Groovy DSL.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Syntax:** While similar to Groovy, there are differences. Pay attention to type declarations and lambda syntax.
    *   **Plugin Application:** Use the `plugins { ... }` block for modern plugin application.
    *   **Accessing Extensions:** Type-safe accessors are generated for plugin extensions, improving reliability.
    *   **Compilation:** Kotlin DSL scripts are compiled, which can catch errors earlier but might slightly increase initial configuration time.

### 5.5. Dependency Management:

*   **Configurations:** Gradle uses configurations (e.g., `implementation`, `api`, `testImplementation`) to define scopes for dependencies.
*   **Version Catalogs:** For larger projects, consider using Gradle Version Catalogs (TOML files) to manage dependency versions centrally, improving consistency and maintainability. This is a best practice for projects with many modules or shared dependencies.
*   **Resolution Strategy:** Use `resolutionStrategy` blocks to handle dependency conflicts (e.g., force a specific version, fail on conflicting versions).

## 6. Comprehensive Build Optimization Strategies for Komga

Once the build is consistently stable, the following optimizations can significantly improve build times and developer experience:

1.  **Gradle Build Cache (`org.gradle.caching=true`):
    *   **Local Cache:** Enabled by default. Stores task outputs locally. Subsequent builds reuse these outputs if inputs haven't changed.
    *   **Remote Cache (e.g., Develocity, Hazelcast-based):** Highly recommended for teams or CI/CD pipelines. Shares task outputs across different machines, dramatically speeding up builds for everyone.
        *   Requires configuration of a cache URL and potentially credentials.
2.  **Gradle Configuration Cache (`org.gradle.configuration-cache=true`):
    *   **Mechanism:** Caches the result of Gradle's configuration phase (the part where build scripts are evaluated and the task graph is built).
    *   **Benefit:** Can lead to massive speedups, especially for projects with complex build logic or many subprojects, as it skips most of the configuration work on subsequent builds.
    *   **Status:** Increasingly stable, but still considered an incubating feature by Gradle. May require build script adjustments for full compatibility.
    *   **Troubleshooting:** Run with `.\gradlew.bat build --configuration-cache-problems=warn` (or `fail`) to identify and fix compatibility issues. Common problems involve tasks that access project properties or external resources at configuration time in a non-cacheable way.
3.  **Parallel Execution (`org.gradle.parallel=true`):
    *   Allows Gradle to execute independent tasks in different modules (or even within the same module if they are not dependent on each other) concurrently.
    *   `org.gradle.workers.max` can control the maximum number of worker processes (defaults to the number of CPU cores).
    *   Was temporarily disabled with `-Dorg.gradle.workers.max=1` for debugging; ensure this is removed or set appropriately for production builds.
4.  **Incremental Builds and Task Inputs/Outputs:
    *   **Concept:** Gradle tasks declare inputs and outputs. If inputs haven't changed since the last execution, and outputs are still present, the task can be skipped (`UP-TO-DATE`).
    *   **Best Practice:** Ensure custom tasks correctly declare all inputs (files, properties, classpath) and outputs for reliable incremental behavior. Most standard tasks (compile, test, etc.) are already well-behaved.
5.  **Build Performance Analysis Tools:
    *   **Build Scans (`.\gradlew.bat build --scan`):
        *   Uploads detailed build information to `scans.gradle.com` (publicly or privately with Develocity).
        *   Provides insights into performance bottlenecks, task dependencies, plugin performance, test results, and environment details. Invaluable for diagnosing slow builds.
    *   **Profiling (`.\gradlew.bat build --profile`):
        *   Generates an HTML report (in `build/reports/profile`) detailing the time spent in different phases and tasks.
        *   Useful for quick local analysis of where build time is going.
6.  **Optimizing Cleanup Scripts (`full_cleanup.bat`, `cleanup.bat`):
    *   **Purpose:** To ensure a truly clean environment, especially when troubleshooting.
    *   **Balance:** While thorough cleaning is good for debugging, overly aggressive cleaning (e.g., wiping the entire global Gradle cache `%USERPROFILE%\.gradle\caches` frequently) can slow down development by forcing re-download of all dependencies.
    *   **Recommendation:** The standard `.\gradlew.bat clean` task should suffice for most project-level cleaning. Reserve global cache cleaning for suspected widespread cache corruption.
7.  **JVM Arguments for Gradle (`org.gradle.jvmargs` in `gradle.properties`):
    *   **Memory Allocation:** Ensure Gradle has enough heap memory (e.g., `-Xmx2g`, `-Xmx4g`, or more for very large projects). Insufficient memory can lead to slow builds or `OutOfMemoryError`.
    *   **Garbage Collection:** Modern JVMs generally have good default GC. Tweaking GC settings is an advanced topic and usually not necessary unless specific performance issues are observed.
    *   **Other Options:** Consider `-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError` for diagnosing memory issues.
8.  **Avoid Unnecessary Work:
    *   **Configure on Demand (`org.gradle.configureondemand=true`):** For multi-project builds, this tells Gradle to configure only the projects relevant to the tasks being executed. Can speed up configuration time.
    *   **Up-to-Date Checks:** Ensure tasks are not re-running unnecessarily due to poorly defined inputs/outputs or volatile inputs.
9.  **Plugin Optimization:
    *   **Review Plugins:** Periodically review the plugins used. Are they all necessary? Are there more performant alternatives?
    *   **Plugin Versions:** Keep plugins updated, as newer versions often include performance improvements and bug fixes.

By systematically applying these strategies, the Komga build process can be made significantly more robust, faster, and easier to maintain.
